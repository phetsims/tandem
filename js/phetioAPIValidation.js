/**
 * This singleton is responsible for ensuring that the phet-io api is correct through the lifetime of the simulation.
 * The phet-io api is defined through multiple preloaded files. The "elements baseline" file holds an exact match of
 * what PhetioObject instances/metadata the sim should create on startup, where the "elements overrides" file is a
 * sparse list that can overwrite metadata without changing the code. See `grunt generate-phet-io-elements-files` for
 * more information. The complete list of checks was decided on in https://github.com/phetsims/phet-io/issues/1453 and
 * is as follows:
 *
 * 1. A full schema is required - any phet-io brand sim without these will have a 404, but this rule isn't tested in this file.
 * 2. Registered PhetioObject baseline must equal baseline schema to ensure that baseline changes are intentional.
 * 3. ~~ is no more
 * 4. After startup, only dynamic instances prescribed by the baseline file can be registered.
 * 5. When the sim is finished starting up, all non-dynamic schema entries must be registered.
 * 6. Any static, registered PhetioObject can never be deregistered.
 * 7. Any schema entries in the overrides file must exist in the baseline file
 * 8. Any schema entries in the overrides file must be different from its baseline counterpart
 * 9. Types in the sim must exactly match types in the types file to ensure that type changes are intentional.
 *
 * Terminology:
 * schema: specified through preloads. The full schema is the baseline plus the overrides, but those parts can be
 *         referred to separately.
 * registered: the process of instrumenting a PhetioObject and it "becoming" a PhET-iO Element on the wrapper side.
 * static PhetioObject: A registered PhetioObject that exists for the lifetime of the sim. It should not be removed
 *                      (even intermittently) and must be created during startup so that it is immediately interoperable.
 * dynamic PhetioObject: A registered PhetioObject that can be created and/or destroyed at any point. Only dynamic
 *                       PhetioObjects can be created after startup.
 *
 * See https://github.com/phetsims/phet-io/issues/1443#issuecomment-484306552 for an explanation of how to maintain the
 * PhET-iO API for a simulation.
